                Text("\nThe Pomodoro Technique is a time management method. The method is used while studying for a while then taking a short break; a longer break is then added when studying for an hour. An example would be studying for 25 minutes then taking a 5 minute break. After doing this 4 times, take a 15 minute break then move on to the next subject. You can make your own routine by basing it off on how long and how much you want to study a certain subject;  you donâ€™t have to stick to the 25/5 method.  The Pomodoro Technique is effective because it gives motivation and helps fight against distractions. \n")
